To connect to the server:
You first have to create a file called dbsetup.java that contains two public static final String's: user and pswd. These will conatain your username and password needed to connect to the database. You can copy the file from the activity we did from lab because it is the exact same file. The file can not exist in the repo because it would cause you to push your password which is not a good idea. If you have questions, just ask me and I will help you get it setup.

To run the gui:
Download "The coding pack for java"
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java
Click install and open in windows not WSL
Run the code from the top right play button
